iCANscout for android

What is iCANscout?

An app that lets you easily scout Vex and FIRST robot matches, calculate rankings and display team results.

We are a group of high school students that has participated in Vex and FIRST robotics for the past few years, 
and have scouted an unnervingly large number of matches. Scouting is the process evaluating other robots during 
matches for the sake of optimizing alliance pairings and deciding on strategies for each match, due to the 
strategy intensive nature of both competitions. Scouting properly can often make the difference between winning 
or losing against other alliances. Most robot teams that scout do so with paper and pencil.  

We believe that there are three big problems with paper and pencil scouting:

It requires multiple people, which lowers the amount of people that can be working on the robot.
It is difficult to sort through all the data that you've collected.
It is time consuming to enter all of the data and score teams
We built an app to make robot scouting faster, easier, and more efficient. iCANscout has these features:


One person can easily input scores for all teams at once through one iPhone or iPod
All data is quickly and automatically sorted to rank the teams that you have scouted.  Rankings are done by total 
score and performance in individual score categoreis, e.g. floor goals.
A short guide to the benefits of scouting and a how to on scouting
The ability to export data onto our website for the robotics community
This last feature is the one that we're the most excited about; with the potential to have detailed match data for 
all competition robots, we will be able to use our website to create a database for scouting and create a platform 
by which we're able to allow teams to be better acquainted with other teams than ever before.

Instead of students building a robot, going to a competition and seeing a lot of cool designs, and then going back 
to iterate, we want to allow teams to use our readily available statistics to determine which strategies are 
working, and which are not.
